### How to use

Add:

```javascript
import 'https://brunozhon.gitub.io/bruno-scripts/script/js/filename.js'; // Remenber to add the semicolon. Even if it's not required, it's recommended. This goes for all lines.
// Next line below
```

Then:

```javascript
// Previous line above
bruno_scripts.funcname(); // Replace funcname with the function name
```

(**Note**: replace `funcname` with the function name)

### Why JavaScript version

There are many file extenstions nowadays. Here are some of them:

- .html
- .css
- .js
- .exe
- .zip
- .asp
- .gitignore
- .npmignore
- .gitmodules
- .pages
- .numbers
- .key

Many of them died off, because they could not surport requirement changes. 

#### What we recommend

We recomend **every website** you make use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. They have not died of, and they are expected to survive for a long period.
